# Binary Search Tree

## Description
Javascript implementation of a
[binary search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree)
data structure.

Work in progress; check back later...

#### Environment:

Although this implementation is designed to be used with
[Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org), it could be used in other contexts with minor
modifications.  This implementation does not have any external dependencies
that would preclude it from being used in the browser--just include it with a
`<script>` tag and it should be good to go.  _Disclaimer: I have not tested
this implementation in any other context/environment; only tested with node.js_

## API
**Available methods for a binary search tree instance:**

### add(value)
  Adds a node to the binary search tree containing 'value'

### contains(value)
  Determines if the binary search tree contains 'value'

### inOrderTraversal(callback)
  Traverses the binary search tree in order, meaning it will visit
  each node in the tree in the order defined by the comparator function.
  Typically this is done from smallest to largest value.
