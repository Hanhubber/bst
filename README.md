#### Environment:

Although this implementation is designed to be used with
[Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org), it could be used in other contexts with minor
modifications.  This implementation does not have any external dependencies
that would preclude it from being used in the browser--just include it with a
`<script>` tag and it should be good to go.  _Disclaimer: I have not tested
this implementation in any other context/environment; only tested with node.js_
